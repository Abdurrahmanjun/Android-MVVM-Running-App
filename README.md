🏃‍♂️ ~ RunningApp is an open source run tracking apps build using Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Jetpack (Room, ViewModel, DataStore), and Material Design. The architecture was based on MVVM architecture. The idea of ​​making this application started from rewriting and following Philipp Lackner's tutorial on youtube, but I customized this project according to my needs.
